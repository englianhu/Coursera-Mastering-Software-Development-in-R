## Miscellaneous

- [Dynamic Documents for R using R Markdown](https://rpubs.com/moviedo/322222) introduce some useful functions and also packages for R users.
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R's quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side.
- [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR) teach us how to use R programming efficiently.
